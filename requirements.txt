Here’s what you need run this:

streamlit
google-generativeai
python-dotenv


Why these?

streamlit → For building and running your app.

google-generativeai → For Gemini AI integration.

python-dotenv → If you later want to load .env files for local API keys (optional but useful).

How to Use

Create the file in your project folder:

nano requirements.txt


Paste in:

streamlit
google-generativeai
python-dotenv


Save & commit to GitHub:

git add requirements.txt
git commit -m "Add requirements.txt for Streamlit deployment"
git push origin main


Redeploy your app on Streamlit Cloud.

Streamlit will see the requirements.txt and auto-install everything.

⚡ Pro Tip
If you ever want to auto-generate all dependencies from your local environment:

pip freeze > requirements.txt


Then edit the file to keep only the ones your project actually needs (to avoid slow installs).
